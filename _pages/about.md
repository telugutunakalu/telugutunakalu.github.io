Objectives:
1. Promoting Telugu Language: Telugu Tunakalu aims to promote the Telugu language among
the younger generation. As language skills are essential for cultural preservation and identity,
we are dedicated to creating awareness about Telugu and encouraging its use.
2. Addressing Attention Span Issues: Recognizing the contemporary challenge of reduced
attention spans, Telugu Tunakalu will provide bite-sized, engaging, and entertaining content
through social media platforms. We believe this approach will make learning and appreciating
Telugu more accessible and enjoyable.
3. Publishing Copyright-Free Books: Telugu Tunakalu will contribute to the accessibility of
Telugu literature by publishing books in a copyright-free format. This will facilitate the
dissemination of Telugu literary works and make them readily available for educational
purposes.
4. Promoting Language Learning: The organization will support language learning by
sponsoring students, providing scholarships, conducting competitive exams, workshops, and
events related to Telugu. By doing so, we aim to encourage and facilitate the acquisition of the
Telugu language.
5. Non-Profit Commitment: Telugu Tunakalu is a non-profit organization, and all revenue
generated will be reinvested into the company's growth and the accomplishment of its
objectives. We are committed to transparency in our financial operations and to directing funds
solely toward our mission.

Existing Social Media Presence:
In addition to our objectives, we would like to highlight that Telugu Tunakalu has already
established a prominent presence on Instagram. Our Instagram handle,
https://www.instagram.com/telugutunakalu/ "@telugutunakalu" boasts a significant following of
11,000 engaged users. This demonstrates our ability to create diversified byte-sized content that
resonates with our audience and supports our mission of promoting Telugu language and
culture through contemporary digital platforms.

Justification for the Name "తెలుగు తునకలు" (Telugu Tunakalu):
The name "తెలుగు తునకలు" or "Telugu Tunakalu" was carefully chosen to reflect our mission and
objectives:
1. Cultural Relevance: "తెలుగు" (Telugu) is the name of the language we aim to promote, and
"తునకలు" (Tunakalu) translates to "bites" or "pieces" in English. This name effectively
communicates our focus on providing bite-sized content.
2. Attention-Capturing: The term "Tunakalu" (bites/pieces) is attention-catching and intriguing,
aligning with our goal to engage the younger generation who may have shorter attention spans.
3. Clarity: The name is straightforward and clear in its intent, leaving no room for ambiguity
about our mission of providing engaging content in the Telugu language.
In conclusion, "తెలుగు తునకలు" or "Telugu Tunakalu" is a name that not only encapsulates our
mission and objectives but is also well-suited to the contemporary challenges of engaging and
promoting the Telugu language to the next generation.
We kindly request your support for the formal registration of our non-profit
organization "తెలుగు తునకలు" (Telugu Tunakalu) and its objectives.
